            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of their MAJESTIES SUGAR PLANTATIONS.</head>
            <p>BEfore <hi>England</hi> had any Sugar-Plantations of its own, <hi>Portugal</hi> had about 400000 <hi>l. Per Annum</hi> for Sugar from <hi>England,</hi> to the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and Impoverishing of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugeeze</hi> having set high Customs upon their Sugars, and letting none Trade at <hi>Brazile</hi> but themselves, gave the <hi>English</hi> Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to adventure upon Planting it; who have so increased, that they not only supply <hi>England</hi> with all the Sugar it wants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 400000 <hi>l.</hi> paid <hi>Portugal</hi> formerly for Sugar, is saved; but great quantities of Sugars have been transported to foreign Markets, to the vast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Wealth of this Kingdom, and by consequence the value of the Lands of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Trade to the <hi>English</hi> Sugar-Plantations, about 800 Sail of <hi>English</hi> Ships, and 10000 Sea-men, are annually employed, besides great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Manufactures, and other the Product of <hi>England</hi> are carried thither for the use of the said Plantations, <hi>viz.</hi> Cloth, Serges, Stuffs, Wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Apparel, Bread, Beer, Flouer, Horse-Harness, Hoops, Guns, Gunpowder, Nails, Tools, and all sorts of Iron-ware, Tin-ware, and Wooden-ware, Coals, wrought Copper, Lead, all sorts of Household-goods, and Materials for Building.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King taking notice of the great Wealth and Strength the Sugar-Plantations bring to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and also of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties the <hi>English</hi> Plantations are under, by reason of the Acts of Trade, which enjoyning all the Sugars of the <hi>English</hi> Plantations to be brought home to <hi>England,</hi> and there to be landed, and pay the King a Custom, before it can be transported to the <hi>Streights,</hi> or any foreign Markets, which is a great charge; hath thought it feizable, and with great application hath set himself to become Master of that Trade; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done the same: and granting more Ease to their Planters, in producing and disposing of their Sugars, than the <hi>English</hi> have, the <hi>French</hi> are so far increased, that their Sugar-Plantations do already find an Employment for a great number of Ships and Sea-men, and are increasing daily: And the <hi>Dutch</hi> have already many Ships annually loaden with Sugar from <hi>Surinam,</hi> which they make a Business of State to improve.</p>
            <p>This increase of the Sugar-Trade of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> had, before the laying the additional Duty in the Reign of the late King <hi>James,</hi> brought those Sugars that were worth between 5 and 6 <hi>l.</hi> the hundred weight, when the last Book of Rates was made, to be worth now not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 45 <hi>s.</hi> out of which the Planter pays 5 <hi>s.</hi> Custom, and 4 ½ <hi>per</hi> hundred to the King in the Plantations; insomuch that an Estate which was heretofore (when Sugar was at that rate) worth 2000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> in the Plantations, came then not to be worth 600 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which was not after the rate of 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for their Stocks: For which reason the Planters, before the laying on the additional Duty, intended to have addressed to the Parliament for reducing the Book of Rates to the present Value of Sugars.</p>
            <p>This low Value of the Commodity caused many of the Inhabitants of the <hi>English</hi> Collonies to forsake them, before the laying the said Duty, and go to other places, whilst the King of <hi>France</hi> useth all imaginable industry to strengthen and fill his Plantations (some of which are in sight of ours) with Inhabitants; having made <hi>Dunkirk</hi> a free Port for his own Sugars, where no Customs are paid in or out: by reason of which the Markets of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. are furnished with <hi>French</hi> Sugars at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> hundred cheaper than the <hi>English</hi> can, by reason of the Acts of Trade.</p>
            <p>This increase of the strength of the <hi>French</hi> Plantations and decrease of the <hi>English,</hi> hath made many of the Planters consider of withdrawing their Stocks, for fear if a War should happen with <hi>France,</hi> all would be lost.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Sugar-Trade being apparently decaying under the old Duty upon Sugar, can by no means bear the new, and subsist; and it is of great advantage to <hi>France</hi> to have our Plantations ruined by the continuance of this Imposition on our Sugars: for should the <hi>French</hi> gain the Sugar-Trade from the <hi>English, England</hi> would lose the Employment of 800 sail of Ships, and 1000 Sea-men, and <hi>France</hi> would gain it; which would differ the present balance of Sea-men 20000, besides the loss of a Native Commodity, that hath brought so much Wealth to the Kingdom, and would also be the loss of the Trade of <hi>Guinea,</hi> which is upheld by the Plantation-Trade.</p>
            <p>It hath ever been the Practice and Policy of Trading Nations, to set the Publick Tax on Forreign Commodities, and not those of their own Growth.</p>
            <p>In the time of the Usurper <hi>Cromwell,</hi> when all things were raked into, to find a Revenue to support his Usurpation, no Excise was put on Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars of the Growth of the <hi>English</hi> Plantations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> is an Island whose Wealth and Strength consists in Trade, which cannot be preserved, but by being Master at Sea; and the Plantation Trade is near one half of the Navigation of <hi>England,</hi> and whether it be so convenient to hazard the loss of it, by laying a Burden upon it that it cannot bear, since an Imposition may be set on Commodities of Forreign growth, that will be equivalent, is humbly submitted.</p>
            <p>This was the sinking Condition of the <hi>English</hi> Sugar-Plantations when the late King <hi>James</hi> the Second came to the Throne; when an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Tax was projected upon Sugar, and a Bill brought into the then House of Commons, for the laying of an Additional Duty of 2 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. per Hundred,</hi> upon all <hi>Muscovado</hi> Sugar, and 7 <hi>s. per Hundred weight,</hi> upon all Sugar made fit for common use or spending of the <hi>English</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Against which Duty the Planters Petitioned, and set forth how unable they were to bear the said Tax. To which the Projectors of the said Tax replyed, <hi>It was ordered in the said Bill, that it was to be paid by the first Buyer, and that it would be born by the Consumptioner, and not at all affect the Planter,</hi> whom they acknowledged were not able to bear it. To which the Planters alledge, <hi>That notwithstanding the pretended Provision made in the said Bill, it would fall wholly upon the Planter.</hi> And the House being pressed to pass the said Bill, by the Ministers of State that were of the House; and told by one of them from the King, <hi>That if by Experience it was found to fall upon the Planter, he would forbear to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it; and at the next Meeting of the Parliament, exchange it for some other Revenue.</hi> And some Members who spake against the said Tax, being required to desist: And the Planters threatned, in case they persisted in their opposition; the said Bill was passed into an Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Since which, several Petitions were presented from the Sugar-Plantations, to the late King; shewing, <hi>That the said Tax was wholly born by the Planters, the Buyers utterly refusing to deal for any Man's Sugars, unless he would pay the said Additional Duty: And when the said Duty was paid by the Planter, he could sell his Sugar for no more then he did before any such Duty was imposed, but rather lower; and which entirely going out of the small Profit the Planter had by making Sugar, could not be born by them: Wherefore, humbly desired, they might be eased of the said Duty, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said King's Promise to the House of Commons:</hi> but could get no Answer to the said Petitions, but were referred to the Commissioners of the Customs, some of which were the Projectors of the said Tax; and were told, That <hi>it was an undecent, not to say an undutiful thing, to put the King in mind of his Promise.</hi> Whereby many of the Families who before lived comfortably, are already undone, several Sugar-works ruin'd, and a general Discouragement laid on all the <hi>English</hi> Sugar-Plantations, and the Expence of our Manufactures, and the Product of this Kingdom extreamly les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened: Whilst at the same time the <hi>French</hi> King gives Encouragement to his Plantations, who increase in Strength, whilst the Inhabitants of the <hi>English</hi> Sugar-Plantations desert them daily for want of means to get a Livelyhood there; which will so weaken them of Defendants, that they are in great danger to become a Prey to the <hi>French,</hi> or their own <hi>Negro</hi> Slaves; which will be a total loss of that profitable Trade to this Kingdom, and be the Ruine of many thousand Families who subsist by it.</p>
            <p>If any one doubts that the Burden of the said Imposition falls wholly upon the Planter, it is ready to be made out by undeniable Demonstration; which the Projectors of this Imposition had never the Confidence to pretend they were able to bear.</p>
